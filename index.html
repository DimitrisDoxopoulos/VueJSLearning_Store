    # v-bind #
    ##########

    Dynamically binds an attribute to an expression
    The attribute we bind now is src and the expression is
    in quotes (image)

    Because v-bind is so much used, there is a shorthand expression
    for it. Instead ov writing v-bind each time, you can just type
        :src
    and it works the same way.

    Other examples of v-bind use are:
        :alt = 'description'
        :href = 'url'
        :title = 'toolTip'
        :class = 'isActive'
        :style = 'isStyled'
        :disabled = 'isDisabled'
    ________________________________________________________________

    ##########
    #  v-if  #
    ##########

    Works as a normal if conditional but in Vue's case we can link it
    easily to an element and display wit when we want

    ________________________________________________________________

    ##########
    # v-show #
    ##########

    We can link this to an element of the DOM. if the value that we
    parse in it will be truthy, we will see the element displayed on
    the window. If it is false, then it will get a css style of
    display: none and will not show

    ________________________________________________________________

    ###########
    #  v-for  #
    ###########

    In the expression of details, details refers to "details" in our
    data (see main.js -> data). This is the collection that we are
    looping over.
    "Detail" is an alias for the elements that we are iterating
    on as we loop through the collection.
    We can use the same alias in the expression to print out each
    string as we loop through them.

    When rendering lists like variant (see main.js -> data), it's
    highly recommended to use a special :key attribute so that Vue
    can keep track of each node's identity. Here we are using the
    shorthand for v-bind to bind the key to our variant's variantId
    value.

    ________________________________________________________________

    ####################
    # Methods and v-on #
    ####################
    
    'Methods' is another property of the Vue instant. We can specify
    methods that can be used in our project. Our button Add To Cart has
    the v-on directive listening for a click. When it happens, v-on
    is hearing it and triggers the addToCart method.

    Because v-on is so common, it has its own shorthand, the @ sign.
    So v-on:click can be specified as @click.

    Other examples of v-on are:
        <form @submit="addToCart">...</form>
        <input @keyup.enter="send">

    .enter is a modifier and what it does is that when the Enter key
    lifts up after it's pressed, the "Send" method will be triggered

    ________________________________________________________________

    #################
    # Style Binding #
    #################
    
   In this example, we have a square div (taking its style from style.css)
   and we are changing its background color based on the variantColor.
   When the expression is evaluated, Vue knows to set the background
   color to Green, so when we render it on the page we see the green div.

   More examples of Style Binding:
        <h1 :style="{ color: color}"> ... </h1>
        <p :style="{ fontSize: fontSize}"> ... </p>

        and in the Vue Instance part:
            data: {
                color: 'red',
                fontSize: '12px'
            }

        or, to be more clean, we can bind style objects like this:
            <p :style="styleObject"> ... </p>
            
            and in the Vue Instance part:
            data: {
                styleObject: {
                    color: 'red',
                    fontSize: '12px'
                }
        
            }
        
        and if we have multiple style objects, we can combine them
        in an array, like this:
            <p :style="[styleObject1, styleObject2]"> ... </p>
            
            and in the Vue Instance part:
            data: {
                styleObject1: {
                    color: 'red',
                    fontSize: '12px'
                },
                styleObject2: {
                    margin: '5px',
                    padding: '20px'
                }
                
            }

    #################
    # Class Binding #
    #################
    
    Let's say that we have a div that already has a class. We can
    dynamically add a class based on whether its expression is evaluating
    to true. Since activeClass is true and errorClass is false, we will
    add a class of "active" but not 'text-danger'. Our initial class
    will still be there.

    <div class="color-box">
        :class="{ active: activeClass, 'text-danger': errorClass }"
    </div>

    JS:
        data: {
            activeClass: true,
            errorClass: false
        }
    
    Like Styling, we can bind an object of classes or an array of
    classes.

    #######################
    # Computed Properties #
    #######################
    
    You can imagine the computed property acting like a calculator
    which is fed values and then it computes with those new values
    in order to return a new value. A thing that we should know about
    computed properties is that they are cached, meaning that the
    result is saved until its dependencies change. It is more efficient
    to use a computed property, rather than a method, for an expensive
    operation that we don't want to rerun every time we access it.

    ##############
    # Components #
    ##############
    
    Components are reusable blocks of code that are used to create a
    more modular and maintainable codebase. To create a component, we
    register it using Vue.component(). The first parameter used is the
    name of our component. The second one is the Options object, which
    is almost identical with the Vue instance Options object. Instead
    of plugging into an element in the dom, like we do in the Vue
    Instance, the component has a "template" property, which specifies
    the structure of our component. Components can contain one root element
    of the dom instance. They can also contain a "data" property but in
    this case "data" is a function that returns a fresh data object for
    each component. Why? Because if it was just a data object and we
    were using that component all over our app, each copy of that
    component would be sharing the same data. if, instead, we return
    a fresh data object from a data function, then each component will
    have its own unique data.

    What if our components are nested somewhere? For example, inside
    a parent component which has some message data? Since components
    have their own isolated scope, they cannot reach outside themselves
    and use the parent's data. Instead, we can use "Props". The prop
    is a custom attribute for passing data into our components. In order
    to receive props, a component needs to explicitly declare the props
    it expects to receive, using the "props" option.

    When declaring your component's props, it is recommended to specify
    requirements but use built in prop validation. To do that, we 
    switch our props array with a props object

    Vue.component('product', {
        props: {
            message: {
                type: String,
                required: true,
                default: "Hi"
            }
        },
        template: `<div>{{ message }}</div>`,
        data() {...}
    })
    ________________________________________________________________

    #########
    # $emit #
    #########
    
    By using $emit, a component can let its parent know that an event
    has happened. A component can use an event handler with the v-on
    directive to listen for an event emission, which can trigger a
    method on the parent. A component can $emit data along with the 
    announcement that an event has occurred. A parent can use data
    emitted from its child.
    
    ________________________________________________________________

    ###########
    # v-model #
    ###########
    
    v-model gives us the ability of "two-way data binding", making
    possible to track changes, for example, in forms and get the data
    a user might be imputing.
    
    ________________________________________________________________

    ###########
    # Mounted #
    ###########
    
    Mounted is a lifecycle hook. In mounted, we put code that we want
    to run as soon as the component is mounted to the DOM.
